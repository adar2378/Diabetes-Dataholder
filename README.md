# Diabetes-Dataholder

I built this simple application for my parents. They can use it to store their diabetes informations using their phone. Very simple to use even for elderly persons. Also I got to learn about SharedPreferences of Android.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

All you need is Android Studio to build the APK file.

### Installing

First of all,  
#### click > Build > Make Project.

Then 
#### > Run > Run appName.

Your project should be built and of course in the debug version.

You can see this generation it in the following directory:
